        There is no universally accepted definition of a <b>mountain</b>. Elevation, volume, relief,<strong>steepness, spacing and continuity </strong>have been used as criteria for defining a mountain.[4] In the Oxford English Dictionary a mountain is defined as <u>"a natural elevation of the earth surface rising more or less abruptly from the surrounding level and attaining an altitude which, relatively to the adjacent elevation, is impressive or notable."[4]

Whether a landform is called a mountain may depend on local usage.</u> <i>John Whittow's</i> Dictionary of Physical Geography[5] states <em>"Some authorities regard eminences above 600 metres (1,969 ft) as mountains, those below being referred to as hills."</em>

In the<small> United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland</small>, a mountain is usually defined as any summit at least 2,000 feet (610 m) high,[6] which accords with the official UK government's definition that a mountain, for the purposes of access, is a summit of 2,000 feet (610 m) or higher.[7] In addition, some definitions also include a topographical prominence requirement, such as that the mountain rises 300 metres (984 ft) above the surrounding terrain.[1] At one time the US Board on Geographic Names defined a mountain as being 1,000 feet (305 m) or taller,[8] but has abandoned the definition since the 1970s. Any similar landform lower than this height was considered a hill. However, today, the US Geological Survey concludes that these terms do not have <mark>technical definitions in the US.[9]</mark>
